How to Set Up Python + Streamlit with Anaconda
🔽 Step 1: Download & Install Anaconda
Go to: 👉 https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Click "Download" → Choose your operating system (Windows).

Download the "64-bit Graphical Installer".

Open the installer and follow the steps:

Accept the license

Install for "Just Me"

Use the default folder

Make sure the box “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable” is unchecked (Anaconda handles it automatically)

✅ Once installed, you now have Python and pip configured through Anaconda Prompt.

🧭 Step 2: Open Anaconda Prompt
Press Windows key → search for “Anaconda Prompt”

Open it (black command window)

Now test:python --version
pip --version


python --version
pip --version
Both should work now.

🚀 Step 3: Create a New Environment for Streamlit (Recommended)
This keeps things clean and isolated.

bash
conda create -n streamlit-env python=3.10

conda create -n streamlit-env python=3.10
Activate it:

conda activate streamlit-env
📦 Step 4: Install Streamlit
Now run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit
Also install libraries your app needs:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
📂 Step 5: Navigate to Your App Folder
Still in Anaconda Prompt, use cd:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd path\to\your\folder
Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Users\Sathvik\Documents\car-purchase-app
▶️ Step 6: Run Your App
Now simply run:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Your app will open in your browser at:
